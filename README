NAME
    Complete - Completion modules family

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Complete (from Perl distribution
    Complete), released on 2014-07-02.

DESCRIPTION
    The namespace "Complete::" is used for the family of modules that deal
    with completion (including, but not limited to, shell tab completion,
    tab completion feature in other CLI-based application, web autocomplete,
    etc).

    Many of the "Complete::*" modules (like, e.g. Complete::Perl,
    Complete::Module, Complete::Unix, Complete::Util) contains
    "complete_*()" functions. These functions are generic, "low-level"
    completion routines: they accept the word to be completed, zero or more
    other arguments, and return an arrayref containing possible completion
    from a specific source. They are not tied to any environment (shell, or
    web). They can even be used for general purposes outside the context of
    completion. Examples are: "complete_file()" (complete from list of files
    in a specific directory), "complete_env()" (complete from list of
    environment variables), and so on.

    "Complete::Bash::*" modules are specific to bash shell. See
    Complete::Bash on how to do bash tab completion with Perl.

    "Complete::Zsh::*" modules are specific to zsh shell. See Complete::Zsh
    on how to do zsh tab completion with Perl.

    "Complete::Fish::*" modules are specific to fish shell. See
    Complete::Fish on how to do fish tab completion with Perl.

    Compared to other modules, this (family of) module(s) tries to have a
    clear separation between general completion routine and
    shell-/environment specific ones, for more reusability.

    Getopt::Complete

    Perinci::Sub::Complete and "Perinci::Sub::Complete::*" modules deal with
    providing completion capability for functions that have Rinci metadata.
